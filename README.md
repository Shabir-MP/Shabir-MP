**Getting Started with Programming**
I began to recognize programming in grade 5 elementary school. At that time, I joined extracurricular activities and began to recognize programming. Since then I began to like programming. Until when I was in junior high school, I started learning about HTML and CSS. I feel very proud to be able to make a web.🌐

Right now, I am studying Python ... I hope the lessons I work on can help the world ..... 🌏
